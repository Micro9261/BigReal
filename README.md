# BigReal
SmartCpp project to implement class BigReal that is capable of storing large real number.  
Requirements: converts from string of digits with optional ',' ,arithmetic operators overload (*,/,-,+) and boolean operators overload (<,>,!=,==).  
Additionally implemented: conversion from builtin variables types, operators (>=, <=) and conversions to string and bool ("0" = false).  
In folder tests (gtest): conv.cpp (conversion tests), bool_oper.cpp (boolean operators tests) and arithm,cpp (arithmetic operators tests).  
Project build using cmake.
